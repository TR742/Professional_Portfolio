            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Richard and welcome to my portfolio page!<br>
                <br>Currently attending the University of Arizona's full stack coding bootcamp, my goal is to create a new career in web development.
                <br>I am 29 years old and currently reside in Gilbert, Arizona along with my beautiful wife and daughter. My hobbies include Arizona sports, disc golf, and just spending as much time with my family as possible.<br>
                <br>Having worked in many different fields like customer service, CNC machine operator, hospitality, and accounting, web development gives me a chance to provide more for my family.<br>
                <br>Thank you for viewing my portfolio!
